          Hi! I’m Myrina Ariana Zafrina Binti Norzafuan — though most people call me Myrina, I usually introduce myself as Rina (after years of hearing it mispronounced, I’ve learned to save us both the trouble!). My close friends call me My, a nickname that’s stuck with me over time. I’m turning 19 this August 3rd, born in Shah Alam and currently living in Bangi, Selangor. I’m a full-time student at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) in Alor Gajah, Melaka, where I’m pursuing a Diploma in Digital Media Communication Technology — a course I chose because of my passion for graphic design and visual storytelling. I’m currently almost finishing my second semester. Before this, I studied at SMK Bandar Seri Putra, Selangor, where I achieved 5As and 3Bs in my SPM. This website was created as part of an assignment for the subject NMC302: Web Design Production, taught by Sir Khairi Bin Khairuddin, where we were tasked with building a personal site based on our hobby. So here I am, blending creativity, code, and a bit of myself into this digital space. Curious to know what hobby inspired it all? Stay tuned — you’re about to find out.

      <p class="hobby-description">
        Reading has always been my cherished hobby, a passion I’ve nurtured since childhood,
        because it offers me so much more than just stories—it’s a gateway to imagination, knowledge,
        and comfort. It all began with fairytale storybooks that enchanted me and inspired me to join
        storytelling competitions, sharing the magic of my favorite tales with others. In my early years,
        my mom often brought me to the library, which quickly became my sanctuary. Surrounded by
        endless shelves of books, I could immerse myself in any story I desired, losing track of time
        until my mom had to gently persuade me to leave. That memory remains one of the defining
        moments of my love for books. As I grew, reading became my chosen hobby because it allows
        me to explore emotions, ideas, and worlds that I wouldn’t encounter otherwise. In my teenage
        years, I was drawn to romantic novels, captivated by their heartfelt narratives. Even during the
        pandemic, when I couldn’t visit bookstores, I turned to online platforms like Wattpad to keep
        my passion alive, though nothing compares to holding a physical book—the texture, scent, and
        connection it provides are truly irreplaceable. Reading not only fuels my imagination and
        curiosity but also gives me a sense of comfort and belonging. To share my love for books, I’ve
        decided to review my top five favorite books on my website, reflecting on the stories that have
        shaped my journey and hopefully inspiring others to discover their own favorites. Stay tuned
        for an exciting adventure into the pages that have left a lasting impact on me!
