      <h1><em>Thank you</em></h1>
      <p>
        for taking the time to get to know a little more about me — from the girl behind the name(s) to the student chasing her creative dreams in digital media. This website is more than just an assignment; it’s a reflection of my journey, my passion for design, and the hobby that keeps me inspired. <br><br>
        This assignment has given me the opportunity to share what I truly love to do — reading and sharing my favorite books with others. Whether you’re here out of curiosity, creativity, or just passing through, I hope you enjoy exploring what I’ve built. And who knows — maybe you’ll discover something new about me, or even about yourself. So go ahead, dive in...<br>and let’s see where this hobby of mine takes us.
      </p>

      <p class="ps-text">
        <strong>P.S.: If you are interested in any book that I’ve reviewed, you can check it out by choosing the book that you want down here. I already set the link where you can purchase it.<br>That’s all from me, bye!</strong>
      </p>
